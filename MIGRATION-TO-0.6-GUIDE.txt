			MIGRATION GUIDE (to 0.6)

Why we are here?
	The version 0.6 is much faster and works better.

Common changes:
	
	- AsyncServer/SocketSession classes are softly deprecated. It still works but you should rewrite your code.
		All clients and servers have been rewritten to new paradigm of ConnectionPool (children: NetworkClient, NetworkServer).
		Therefore, you cannot use old API of WebSocketServer (and etc). E.g. you should use WebSocketServer::getInstance()->addRoute(....).
		New examples of code you can find in app-examples. There are no major changes, you can update your code in a couple of minutes.
		
		Config sections like [WebSocketServer, FlashPolicy, ...] should be written as usually but in new format:
		 	Pool:MyApp[:instanceName] {}
		For example:
			Pool:FlashPolicyServer {
			} 
			
		Or:
		 	Pool:FlashPolicyServer:mySecondInstance {
				listen-port 12345;
				file /tmp/file.xml;
			}
			
		
		In fact, "Pool" application shall call the object (FlashPolicyServer extends NetworkServer extends ConnectionPool), and be proxy for signals (shutdown, reload, update).
		
		You may look at app-examples/ExampleWithRedis.php to understand how to use clients.
